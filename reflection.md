Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

This class represents a witch going about their daily life. I implemented an insideHouse and outsideHouse method for the user to walk in and outside their house to fly or walk outside and to keep track of what the witch can and cannot do realistically (or as realistic as much as a witch can be). Everything pretty much worked, but it was difficult to figure out the syntax for implementing interfaces at first. Some advice I would give is to go wild. Have fun with this project and don't be afraid to add anything. 

This class that I made is a Witch. They can walk around their house and outside their house. They can fly on their broom, make potions, and cast spells. They can shrink or grow, with some limitations, and then undo all of their actions.
